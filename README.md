# 1-GNN-Clustering

This is the complimentary code for the WIDECOMM 2023 Paper Submission: <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-47126-1_4">Clustering and Communication Efficiency with GNNs in the Internet of Vehicles</a> This code contains the K-Means Clustering model with three GNN approaches: GAT, GCN, and GraphSAGE. It compares against a baseline approach with just K-Means. To use a specific GNN, you must modify the encoder to reflect these parameters. 




Enjoy!
